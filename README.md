## 🎮 Life Beyond Code

When I’m not deep in code, you’ll probably find me out on the **soccer field** or lifting ideas (and the occasional dumbbell) at the gym.  
I love exploring the **latest in AI**, binge-watching gripping TV shows, and connecting over good tech convos or matchday highlights.  
**Let’s build, learn, and vibe — together.**
