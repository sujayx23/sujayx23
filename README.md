🎮 Life Beyond Code  
When I’m not deep into code, you’ll probably find me chasing a ball on the soccer field or lifting ideas (and sometimes actual weights) at the gym.  
I’m always exploring the latest in AI and tech — it’s where my curiosity lives.  
And when it’s time to chill, I’m all about binge-worthy shows and great conversations — hit me up with recs or collab ideas!
